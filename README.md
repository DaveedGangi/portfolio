# Portfolio Project 🚀

This project is a personal portfolio website built with React.js to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. It features a modern design, smooth navigation, and interactive elements to provide an engaging user experience. The portfolio includes sections for an introduction, skills, work experience, and a contact form. A Dialogflow chatbot is integrated for user support.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Interactive Initial Animation:** A welcoming animation displayed on initial load to grab the user's attention.
- **Smooth Navigation:** Utilizes `react-scroll` for seamless scrolling between sections.
- **Project Showcase:** Dedicated "Work" page to display projects with descriptions, images, and links to GitHub repositories and live demos.
- **Skills Section:** Showcases technical skills with icons and links to documentation.
- **Contact Form:** Allows visitors to send emails directly through the website using EmailJS.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Dialogflow Chatbot:** Integrated chatbot for user support and answering common questions.
- **Map Integration:** Displays a map using `react-leaflet` to show location.
- **Typing Animation:** Uses `react-typed` to create a dynamic typing effect in the introduction.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
